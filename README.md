## About the data

Data is available in JSON format.

National park entries contain fields for the park name, and the location of the park

#### Example Park Result

```
    {
        "stateId": 5,
        "name": "Death Valley",
        "location": "California"
    },
```

#### Parsing the Data

# GET requests

Search for national parks, and use parameters to customize your results. Valid parameters include `name`, `location`

## National park search

Use this endpoint to find a list of all results, or all matching a query. Make a GET request for all parks matching a query, adjusting for pagination preferences, by adding parameters in the format of `?` + `{parameter-name}={search-term}`, separated by `&`, to the standard route format. Each query parameter is optional, and any combination of parameters can be used.

### Retrieve All

A GET request for all parks follows the following route format:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/
http://localhost:5000/api/states/
```

\_Note: The default result is set to 10 parks.

### Pagination

The National Park Directory API returns a default of 10 results at a time, and a maximum of 1000. `limit` and `start` query parameters change the results given. The `limit` specifies how many results should be returned, and the `start` parameter specifies at which element in the set the limit should start counting.

To use default, don't include `limit` and `start` or set them equal to zero.

## Retrieve one park

A GET request for an individual park follows the following route format:

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/{nationalId}

```

Use this type of request to pull a single park based on the park's `nationalId`.

<details>
  <summary>Example GET by ID</summary>

```
http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/2
```

Body:

```
{
    {
        "nationalId": 2,
        "name": "Yosemite",
        "location": "California"
    },
}
```

</details>

# All other requests

Requests returning a 200 OK status have successfully posted.

#### Request Format

Format POST and PUT request content as JSON objects in the request body. Include the ID of the entry for PUT and DELETE requests.

## Add a park

A PUT request follows the following route format:

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals

```

<details>
  <summary>Example POST</summary>

```
http://localhost:5000/api/nationals
```

Body:

```
    {
        "name": "Yosemite",
        "location": "California"
    }
```

</details>

## Edit a park

A PUT request follows the following route format:

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/{nationalId}

```

The body must be formatted the same way as a POST request to add a new park. All fields not included, even if they are not the field to be modified, will be overwritten as `null`.

<details>
  <summary>Example PUT</summary>

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/6

```

Body:

```
    {
        "nationalId": 2,
        "name": "Yosemite",
        "location": "California"
    }

```

</details>

## Remove a park

A DELETE request follows the following route format:

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/{nationalId}

```

A DELETE request will delete the park with the matching ID.

<details>
  <summary>Example DELETE</summary>

```

http://localhost:5000/api/nationals/8

```

</details>
